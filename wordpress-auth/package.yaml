synopsis:
    Validate Wordpress Cookies & Nonces; Build Wordpress Hashes & Salts
description: >
    This package is used for validating Cookie data & Nonces from Wordpress.

    You may find it useful if you're trying to serve a Haskell application
    alongside a Wordpress site. By validating the Cookies set by Wordpress, you
    can access the currently logged-in Wordpress user in Haskell without having
    to devise a Wordpress-to-Haskell authentication scheme.

    It includes a generalized authentication function, as well as various
    helpers, validators, & hashers if you'd like to build a custom
    authentication process.

    Servant users may want to just use the @servant-auth-wordpress@ package.
